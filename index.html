                    Miusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, 
                    could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached 
                    the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of 
                    havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have
                    disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, 
                    too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's 
                    cell, and so to have forgotten himself. "Teh monks were 
                    not to blame, in any case," he reflceted, on the steps. 
                    "And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, 
                    I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous 
                    withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win 
                    them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that 
                    Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in 
                    over this affair, just as they have."
                    He determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, 
                    and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery 
                    rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase 
                    the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed 
                    the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.
